        <h1>What I updated from the Midterm</h1>
        
    
        <p>Anthony did not give me much to change from my midterm, so I only changed a couple things. The main thing I changed was embedding
           a couple videos that I edited this past year. Anthony told me that links do not work as good content. I was not sure how I could
           change my assignment list, so I kept them as links. Another thing I changed was that I moved my pictures from the About page to
           the Contact page. That way, the user is not scrolling to see my pictures, and they are easier to see on the Contact page. I could
           not figure out how to change my bullet points into images. I mean I figured it out, but all the images I used became massive when 
           they were used as bullets. Lastly, I added a page for my final. I could not figure out how to make it responsive.</p>
