                <h2>Personal Life</h2>
                <p>I am currently a student at the <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/" target="_blank">University of Colorado Boulder</a>. 
                    I am majoring in Business Administration with an emphasis in Strategy and Entreprenuership, and minoring in 
                    Creative Design and Technology. Throughout my time at CU, I have taken a variety of classes from sustainable operations
                    to web design. These class have given me the knowledge to become a business professional while pursuing my passion
                    of graphic design. I could not be more <strong>thankful</strong> with my course load over these past few years.
                </p>
                <p>Growing up in Atlanta, GA, I would spend alot of my summers in the Blue Ridge Mountains and other national parks around 
                   the US. I connected with nature and found a love for the Great Outdoors rather than with the city of Atlanta. I never was
                   a big fan of cement jungles; however, I have always been a fan of natural jungles and mountain ranges. Throughout my
                   years, I have been involved in many outdoor activities such as rock climbing, white water rafting, and hiking to name a 
                   few. But none of them excite me as much as backapcking. The longest backapcking trip I have ever been on was a 6-day trip
                   along the Colorado portion of the continental divide; it was an amazing experience. Due to my love for nature and
                   backpacking, it has been a lifelong goal of mine to thru-hike the <a href="https://appalachiantrail.org/" target="_blank">Appalachian Trail</a>, 
                   which is approximately 2,200 miles long. If everything goes according to plan, I am going to thru-hike it right after 
                   graduation in May and end around November. Wish me luck!
                </p>

                    <h2>About This Site</h2>
                    <p>I created this website for one of my classes at the University of Colorado Boulder: ATLS 2200 - Web. Throughout This
                       class, I have learned HTML and CSS, and I will learn Java Script later on the semester. My professor, 
                       <a href="https://www.anthonypinter.com/" target="_blank">Anthony Pinter</a>, has a pretty cool and interactive 
                       website, so I modeled some of my headings after his website. The design of the website is of my own creation, and
                       I wanted to create a solid color scheme where most of the colors contrasted well with each other. Listed below are
                       some of my goals for the Web design class.
