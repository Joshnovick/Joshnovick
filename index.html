                <h2>Hello</h2>
                <p>Ever since I was little, I have been a creative person. Because of this love of creativity and art, I was drawn to 
                    graphic design. I enjoy expressing myself through various mediums, and being a graphic designer lets me accomplish
                    just that. I am especially fond of logo design, video editing and typographic design. It is fascinating how different 
                    design elements and theories work together to create a beautiful masterpiece.
                </p>
                <p>I am currently working on a new venture in one of my classes called <a href="https://joshnovick.wixsite.com/blazinjoe-com" target="_blank">Blazin Joe</a>.
                    Every year, coffee shops throw out millions of tons of coffee grounds to landfills where they contribute to climate 
                    change by releasing methane into the atmosphere. Composting is not the answer as only 5% of coffee shops nationwide have
                    the ability to compost. That is why we created Blazin' Joe, an environmentally proactive company that upcycles spent 
                    coffee grounds into superior fire logos; we can turn trash into cash.
