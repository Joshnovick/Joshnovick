        <p>I am excited for this course because I have <strong>always</strong> wanted to create websites.</p>
        <p>My goals for this course include:</p>
        <p>- Learn the basics of HTML</p>
        <p>- Learn how to <em>stylistically</em> format a website</p>
        <p>- Create a personal website</p>
        <p>I'm sure you have been dying to get to know me, so here is a little bit about myself. 
           Before we get started, here is a <a href="/img/josh.jpg" target="_blank">picture of myself</a> so you know what I look like.
           I was born and raised in a suburb of Atlanta, GA. 
           When I was growing up, I had a fascination for music, so my parents got me piano lessons when I was five-years-old.
           Now, I absolutely love music, and I appreciate <strong>all</strong> kinds of music!
