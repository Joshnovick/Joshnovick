            <p>I'm sure you have been dying to get to know me, so here is a little bit about myself. 
            Before we get started, here is a <a href="/img/josh.jpg" target="_blank">picture of myself</a> so you know what I look like, but I have also attached a picture to the website.
            I was born and raised in a suburb of Atlanta, GA. 
            When I was growing up, I had a fascination for music, so my parents got me piano lessons when I was five-years-old.
            Now, I absolutely love music, and I appreciate <strong>all</strong> kinds of music!
