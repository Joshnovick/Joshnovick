                <h2>Hello</h2>
                <p>Ever since I was little, I have been a creative person. Because of this love of creativity and art, I was drawn to 
                    graphic design. I enjoy expressing myself through various mediums, and being a graphic designer lets me accomplish
                    just that. I am especially fond of logo design, video editing and typographic design. It is fascinating how different 
                    design elements and theories work together to create a beautiful masterpiece.
                </p>
                <p>I am currently working on a new venture in one of my classes called <a href="https://joshnovick.wixsite.com/blazinjoe-com" target="_blank">Blazin Joe</a>.
                    Every year, decaying coffee grounds release about 6 million tons of methane into the atmosphere. That is why we 
                    created Blazin Joe, an environmentally proactive waste management company that upcycles spent coffee grounds into 
                    recreational fire logos. In order to help us with our customer discovery, I would appreciate it if you took the time 
                    to fill out this short <a href="https://forms.gle/MyhsavCgxG2vWBsr7" target="_blank">survey</a>. Thank you!
                </p>
                <p>For more information about me and this site, take a look at my <a href="/about.html">about page</a>.
